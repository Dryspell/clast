## Regular MDX Features

You can use all the regular MDX features like:

- Lists
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `inline code`

```javascript
// Code blocks
function hello() {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}
```

> Blockquotes are also supported!

## Using Components

MDX allows you to use React components directly in your markdown:

<div className="bg-blue-100 p-4 rounded-lg">
  This is a custom React component inside MDX!
</div>
