# Welcome to Our Documentation

This is a sample documentation page that demonstrates our enhanced MDX capabilities with admonitions.

:::note[Important Note]
This is a note with a custom title! You can use **bold**, _italic_, and `inline code` in both the title and content.

- Lists work too
- With full Markdown support
:::

:::tip[Pro Tip!]
Here's a helpful tip with a custom title. You can even include code blocks:

```typescript
function hello() {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}
```
:::

:::info
This is a regular info box without a title. It's great for general information.

> You can use blockquotes and other Markdown features inside admonitions!

This is a warning with a title. Pay attention to:
1. Important points
2. Critical details
3. Key considerations

## Nested Admonitions

You can even nest admonitions:
